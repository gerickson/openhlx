NAME
----
hlxsimd - HLX control server simulator daemon

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'hlxsimd' [<options>] [{ <URL> | <host[:port]> }]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `hlxsimd` command line program is used to simulate an Audio
Authority HLX Series Modular Matrix System High Definition Audio/Video
Switching System.

`hlxsimd` endeavors to represent with high-fidelity any implemented
HLX control command responses and the attendant data model such that a
client developed against it may be used interchangeably with real HLX
hardware. Consequently, `hlxsimd` serves a useful role in developing
and maintaining HLX clients.

Buffering and Multiplexing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
One significant departure between real HLX hardware and `hlxsimd` is
the number of concurrent client sessions and how buffering and
multiplexing across sessions are handled.

In the case of real HLX hardware, concurrent client sessions are
limited to two (2). Input/output is handled `character` at a time and
command responses and data model state change notifications are
multiplexed across all connections `character` at a time as
well. There are two implications of this. First, particularly for
query commands such as 'Query Current Configuration [QX]', the
response is incredibly slow. Second, particularly when more than one
connection is active, the output among any client is interleaved,
resulting in unparseable and, by extension, corrupt output. This
renders concurrent client usage all but unusable when more than one
command request and/or response is in flight.

By contrast, the number of concurrent client sessions in `hlxsimd` is
limited only by the system resources on which it runs. In addition,
`hlxsimd` implements `buffer` at a time input/output and
multiplexing. The latter not only speeds the responsiveness of the
control protocol, speeding the initial data model configuration and
state transfer by %1,000 or more, but allows for concurrent client
sessions that do not corrupt one another.

The HLX to be simulated by `hlxsimd` may be either a 'URL' or 'host' with
optional port, where the hostname portion of 'URL' or the literal
'host' can be a numerical IP address or symbolic hostname.

OPTIONS
-------
`hlxsimd` supports the following general and server-specific options:

General Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-d::
--debug ['LEVEL']::
    Enable diagnostic output, optionally at level 'LEVEL'.

-h::
--help::                          
    Print `hlxsimd` help, then exit.

-q::
--quiet::
    Run silently, suppressing all diagnostic and informative output.

-s::
--syslog::
    Write all error, diagnostic and informative output only to the
    system log, rather than to both the system log as well as standard
    error and standard output.

-v::
--verbose ['LEVEL']::
    Enable verbose output, optionally at level 'LEVEL'.

-V::
--version::
    Print the `hlxsimd` version, then exit.

Server Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-4::
--ipv4-only::
    Force `hlxsimd` to use IPv4 addresses only.

-6::
--ipv6-only::
    Force `hlxsimd` to use IPv6 addresses only.

--configuration-file 'FILE'::
    Use file 'FILE' as the configuration backing store (default:
    $(prefix)/var/hlxsimd/hlxsimd.plist).

FILES
-----

If not explicitly set with `--configuration-file`, there is one file where `hlxsimd` will both read and write active configuration and state for the HLX instance being simulated:

$(prefix)/var/hlxsimd/hlxsimd.plist::
    System-wide configuration and state.

CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------
The `hlxsimd` configuration file contains the active configuration and
state for the HLX being simulated. When present, it is loaded from on
`hlxsimd` start-up or in response to the "Load Configuration [LOAD]"
command. It is saved to in response to the "Save Configuration [SAVE]"
command or, just like real HLX hardware, on a 30 second auto-save
timer when there is "dirty" configuration or state to save.

Format
~~~~~~
The `hlxsimd` configuration file is maintained in the Property List
format.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
'hlxsimd' exits with one of the following values:

    0  `hlxsimd` teriminated successfully.

    1  `hlxsimd` failed to initialize or start or terminated unsuccessfully.

LIMITATIONS
-----------
In addition to the aforementioned changes in the number of supported
client sessions, buffering, and multiplexing, `hlxsimd` does `not`
presently support `all` of those control commands supported by real
hardware and documented in 'HLX Series Modular Matrix System High
Definition Audio/Video Switching System: Installation and Operation'.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no support for the "Query Current Configuration, Respond in
Square Brackets [QXSB]" command.

Favorites
~~~~~~~~~
Beyond querying and naming favorites, there is no further support for
the favorites commands and functionality.

Groups
~~~~~~

- Breakaway (that is, independent) switching of audio and video
  sources for a single group.

Network
~~~~~~~
There is only support for querying the current network settings;
however, there is no support for modifying the current network
settings.

Restrictions
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is no support for the restrictions commands and functionality.

Zones
~~~~~

- Breakaway (that is, independent) switching of audio and video
  sources for a single or all zones.
- Tracking.
