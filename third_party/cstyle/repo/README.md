# Introduction

cstyle is used to flexibly and parametrically check for C and
C++ code formatting style compliance.

Philosophically, this assumes it is working on compilable
code. Consequently, this does not endeavor to be nor is it a
grammatically-correct source code parser.

Where possible, effort is expended to make the syntax, option
invocation, and output familiar to users of compilers and other
linting and formatting tools for ease of use and efficient
system integration.
